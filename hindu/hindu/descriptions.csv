Gujarat to move HC on fine reduction for not wearing mask,"The Gujarat government on Tuesday said it would approach the High Court to seek its nod to reduce the fine for not wearing a mask in public places from ₹1,000 to ₹500 as COVID-19 cases had come down drastically in the State. On Tuesday, the State reported 135 cases and 3 deaths. The State has been levying ₹1,000 as fine as part of its stringent enforcement of COVID-19 rules as directed by the High Court which had initiated  public interest litigation petition on the COVID-19 situation in Gujarat. Now, the government feels that since the cases have subsided and vaccination numbers are rising, the fine for not wearing a mask should be reduced to ₹500 from ₹1,000.

Focus on people-centric agenda in post-COVID transitions,"The post-COVID-19 development transitions should be managed through people-centric agendas, robust civic engagements and vibrant public-private partnerships, as such an approach will help make progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) intended to be achieved by 2030, according to the findings of a research conducted by a development studies institution here. The challenges could be met through the government’s partnership with private institutions and industry as co-drivers of growth for greater public good, it said. Overcoming the digital divide and capacity building of weaker sections were identified as other important elements to bring the economy back on rails. The School of Development Studies (SDS) at the Indian Institute of Health Management Research (IIHMR) here took up the research to identify the areas of intervention for ensuring people’s welfare during the pandemic and equipping them to face the third wave, which is likely to hit the rural areas later this year. At a virtual national conclave for holding deliberations on challenges and opportunities post-COVID, IIHMR president P.R. Sodani said though the outcomes of research were meant for betterment of the community at large, the Union and State governments would play an important role in rehabilitation of the affected people. While Dr. Sodani said the key stakeholders should join hands to achieve the 17 interlinked SDGs designed to achieve sustainable future for all, Goutam Sadhu, professor at the SDS, laid emphasis on the role of professionals in the development, healthcare and livelihood sectors in tackling the challenges posed by the pandemic, which had caused economic downturn for all sections of society. The research has highlighted the key aspects of supply chain uncertainties during the pandemic and their management implications, while recommending steps to strengthen the institutions, encourage funding through corporate social responsibility and reconstruct the rights-based approach for development.

Plea for 100% procurement by Centre,"An application has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the Central government’s policy to allow 25% of the domestically manufactured COVID-19 vaccines to be procured by private hospitals. The plea filed by John Brittas, CPI(M) Rajya Sabha MP, and Professor R. Ramakumar of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, said that the new policy will cause a reservation for the rich and urban people. The application has urged the top court to direct the Centre to take over 100% procurementThe plea has cited statistics from the past vaccination drives, including tuberculosis, DPT3 and polio, where contribution of the private sector was negligible. Already, the application argues, there is a massive under-utilisation of vaccines by the private hospitals.

Many opposition parties skip Rashtra Manch meeting hosted by Sharad Pawar," The Rashtra Manch meeting hosted by Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar in the Capital on Tuesday turned out to be a damp squib with a majority of the opposition parties giving it a miss and many of them sending in second line leaders. The Rashtra Manch was an action group founded by Yashwant Sinha in January 2018 when he was not in any party. He is currently with the Trinamool Congress. Also read | The NCP was at pains to explain that Mr. Pawar was only playing the host and did not organise the meeting. It also explained that there was no deliberate exclusion of the Congress. Other than the Congress, the DMK, the RJD and the BSP too did not send in any representatives. Speaking to the media after the meeting, NCP leader Majeed Memon said, “It has been reported in the media that this meeting of Rashtra Manch was held by Sharad Pawar to unite anti-BJP parties. This is totally incorrect. I want to clarify that this meeting took place at Mr. Pawar’s residence but he didn’t call this meeting.” He also stressed that the meeting should not be misconstrued as a big political step taken by Mr. Pawar excluding the Congress. “Congress leaders Vivek Tankha, Manish Tewari, Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Shatrughan Sinha were invited. Some of them expressed genuine difficulties. The perception that there is going to be a big Opposition group excluding the Congress is wrong,” Mr. Memon said. The participants included National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, Rashtriya Lok Dal’s Jayant Chaudhary, Aam Aadmi Party’s Susheel Gupta, poet Javed Akhtar, former Chief Election Commissioner S.Y. Qureshi, former diplomat K.C. Singh and Justice (retired) A.P. Shah among others. CPI General Secretary D. Raja and CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury too gave it a miss. Instead the CPI was represented by Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswom and the CPI (M) by Polit Bureau member Nilotpal Basu. Rashtra Manch coordinator and Samajwadi Party spokesperson Ghanshyam Tiwari said Mr. Sinha, who was the convener of this platform, would set up a team that would put forth its vision on important issues affecting citizens. “The summary of the meeting is that there is a need for preparation of an alternative vision in the country that is strong to address issues related to the common man,” Mr. Tiwari said.

Rajasthan: Independent MLAs supporting Ashok Gehlot govt to meet in Jaipur," Amid a political turmoil in the Rajasthan Congress, a meeting of Independent MLAs supporting the Ashok Gehlot government will be held in Jaipur on June 23. The meeting has been called to discuss the current political situation in the State, the Independent legislators said. However, it is not yet clear whether the six MLAs who had switched over to the Congress from the BSP will attend the meeting. Earlier, there was speculation that the BSP defectors would be a part of the meet. There are 13 Independent MLAs and six BSP MLAs who have joined the Congress in the State. Rajkumar Gaur, an Independent MLA from Ganganagar said, “No meeting was held for a long time, so this has been scheduled. All MLAs will meet and discussions on the current political situation will also take place.” The meeting is being held at a time when the State government has begun making much-awaited political appointments in urban local bodies and is even mulling expansion of the State Cabinet. While the Sachin Pilot camp has been pushing for political appointments and Cabinet expansion, the legislators who came from the BSP have said the Congress high command should “reward those who stood by the government during last year’s political crisis”. Meanwhile, independent MLA Ramkesh Meena on June 22 targeted the former Deputy Chief Minister and legislators supporting him accusing them of trying to topple the State government last year. Talking to reporters, Mr. Meena said, “Those who tried to topple the government while being State president are talking about the interest of party workers. Where else can such an example be seen in the country.” “Out of 13 Independent MLAs, 10-11 are those who have Congress background but were forced to fight as Independents. They won and are with Ashok Gehlot,” Mr. Meena said. He alleged that a conspiracy is being hatched at the behest of the BJP to destabilise the State government.

₹870-cr. fillip to electric vehicles in Gujarat,"To encourage usage of electric vehicles, the Gujarat government on Tuesday announced a four-year ₹870-crore policy to provide subsidy on the purchase of non-polluting battery-powered vehicles in the state. A subsidy of up to ₹20,000 on electric two-wheelers, ₹50,000 on electric three-wheelers and ₹1,50,000 on electric four-wheelers will be provided. The incentives are similar to those offered by Bihar but higher than Delhi, Maharashtra and Kerala. The policy was announced by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani who stressed on creating necessary infrastructure like setting up of charging stations to encourage people to switch from conventional vehicles using fossil fuel to battery-powered vehicles which drastically help in improving clean air in the cities. Around 1,25,000 two-wheelers, 75,000 three-wheelers and 25,000 four-wheelers will benefit from these subsidies which will be based on per kilowatt hour of the vehicle, the Gujarat CM said. While Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala and Bihar have rolled out subsidy schemes, other States have provided tax reliefs. “The EV policy will be in force for four years. We also want to promote EV usage and Gujarat as a destination for the production of EVs. We are aiming to cut 6,00,000 tons of carbon emission and ₹5 crore worth of fuel cost through this policy every year. We will be providing subsidies for charging stations too,” the Chief Minister said during the policy announcement in Gandhinagar. The subsidy will be provided for private and commercial vehicles and will be in addition to the subsidy available under the Centre’s FAME-II scheme for EVs. Besides, registration will be free. The per kilowatt subsidy will be double of that available in any State, the government claimed. So far, 278 charging stations, mostly on highways, have been approved and 250 more are planned soon with the rise of battery-operated vehicles. “We thank the Gujarat government for notifying the new EV policy which is both progressive and comprehensive in nature. The policy outlines clear adoption strategies, especially in the last mile mobility segment. The fiscal benefits will directly benefit the end customer while the non-fiscal benefits will help develop the overall EV ecosystem,” said Mahesh Babu, CEO, Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd.

Quick vaccination vital: V.K. Paul,"Quick vaccination is key to opening the economy and going back to normal, said Member (Health), NITI Aayog, Dr. V. K. Paul, speaking to DD News, according to a release issued by the Health Ministry on Tuesday. The Ministry said India now aimed to vaccinate at least one crore people a day. Dr. Paul added that a third wave could be stopped if COVID Appropriate Behaviour was followed and a majority of the people got vaccinated. “Why will there be a third wave if we follow COVID Appropriate Behaviour and get ourselves vaccinated? There are many countries where even second wave has not arrived; if we follow COVID appropriate behaviour, this period will pass,” he said. Highlighting the importance of vaccination, he said: “We need to do our daily work, maintain our social life, open schools, businesses, take care of our economy; we will be able to do all this only when we are able to vaccinate at a fast pace.”Meanwhile, the Health Ministry said it had ensured that full supplies of COVID-19 vaccines under the direct State procurement are provided to States before 21st June.

"Sushil Ansal hid facts to renew his passport, police tell court","The Delhi Police told a court here that Sushil Ansal — convicted in the 1997 Uphaar cinema fire incident that killed 59 people — played a fraud on authorities by concealing information about criminal cases pending against him while getting his passport renewed. “From the investigation, it is clear that Sushil Ansal had deliberately concealed the information regarding criminal proceedings pending against the applicant in any court of law or that she/ he has not been convicted by any court of law for any criminal offence in the past,” the police said in its chargesheet. It also said Mr. Ansal was issued a passport in 2013 on a “tatkaal” application. The affidavit under the “tatkaal” scheme required specific deposition by the applicant to the effect that there were no criminal proceedings pending against the applicant in any court of law or that she/ he has not been convicted by any court of law for any criminal offence in past. “This affidavit was filed by Ansal alongwith his application, which resulted in the issuance of a passport in 2013. The accused benefitted from the said passport....He has on oath misled the government authority [Regional Passport Office] that he has not been convicted in any criminal proceedings by any court,” the police added. “Ansal was fully aware of the provisions of Passport Act. He had deliberately left the relevant boxes in the application form pertaining to criminality or court proceedings unticked,” it said in the chargesheet. The inquiry was initiated on the direction of the High Court after a petition was filed by Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) through its chairperson Neelam Krishnamoorthy claiming that the real estate tycoon deliberately made false declarations about his criminal proceedings while applying for passport. The police had earlier informed the High Court that in 2013, three criminal cases, including the Uphaar fire tragedy matter, were pending against Ansal. Krishnamoorthy, who lost her two children in the tragedy, has been fighting a legal battle on behalf of the victims’ families for the last 20 years. A fire at Uphaar cinema during the screening of Hindi film “Border” on June 13, 1997, killed 59 people.

"Coronavirus | Over 50 lakh jabs given in a single day again on June 22, 2021","Until 9 p.m. on June 22, over 5.28 million new doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in India which is only the second instance when the number of doses in a single day crossed the 5 million-mark. A day before, 8.73 million doses were administered, the highest-ever in a single day since the inoculation drive began. Between June 1 and 21, 3.46 million doses were administered daily in India on an average. At the current rate, a total of 960 million doses can be administered by December 31, 2021, which is just over half the doses required to fully vaccinate all adults(1880.37 million doses).

"Coronavirus | Day after record vaccination, M.P.’s vaccine numbers fall","After administering a record-breaking 16.9 lakh vaccine doses on single day on Monday — the highest among all States — Madhya Pradesh plummeted to a record low of only 4,563 shots on Tuesday, according to data on the CoWin portal . India posted an all-time high of 89 lakh doses on Monday, the first day of the new liberalised policy with the Centre procuring vaccines on behalf of the States. While many States had substantially increased the number of vaccines administered, M.P., Haryana and Karnataka had posted the most significant increases when compared to the average daily doses per month. Until its feat on Monday, M.P. had at most administered five lakh doses per day in June. While vaccination in most States dips around the weekend, it had plummeted to only 692 doses in the State on Sunday, a day before the drive. However, the daily doses in M.P. have remained above 5,000 in June.  Unless there is a revision to the data, Tuesday’s figures is would be an all-time low in Madhya Pradesh barring the Sunday anomaly. There were 3,100 vaccination sessions in the State on Monday, which and that fell to 264 on Tuesday with capital Bhopal only recording 453 inoculations on Tuesday from 150,000 on Monday. Media reports said that on Monday, which the Centre celebrates as International Yoga Day, M.P. had a concerted vaccination drive with Chief Minister, Shivraj Chouhan, personally visiting sites and monitoring progress. Karnataka too posted a decline from the Monday’s high with only 3.8 lakh shots on Tuesday evening compared to 11 lakh on Monday. However, the State has consistently administered over 3 lakh shots since June 5 and so the Tuesday's numbers aren't an aberration. Haryana which administered 5 lakh doses on Monday fell to about 74,000 on Tuesday which again isn't too far outside its normal range. The peaks it has attained in June are a little over 1 lakh doses a day. Uttar Pradesh, which administered 7.25 lakh doses on Monday followed it up with 7.41 lakh doses on Tuesday and this is above it's average of over 4 lakh doses daily. Maharashtra administered 5.48 lakh doses on Tuesday, more than the 3.83 lakh on Monday. On Tuesday, India had administered 51 lakh doses — a significant number against its average this month of a little above 35 lakh doses. Health Ministry officials on Tuesday insisted that Monday’s numbers weren’t a flash in the pan.  “The increase in vaccinations yesterday wasn't sudden. The average number of vaccinations was nearly 34 lakh per day from June 1 to June 21. To go from there to 88 lakh is possible, when vaccines and capacity is available. This was a result of coordinated planning between States and Centre and is expected to continue,” Rajesh Bhushan, Secretary, Ministry of Health said at a press conference on Tuesday.

MPs panel seeks survey on pandemic impact on malnutrition,"A parliamentary panel on Tuesday asked the Ministry of Women and Child Development to conduct a survey on the impact of the pandemic on anganwadi services and malnutrition levels among children. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports chaired by Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe is learnt to have grilled the officials of the Ministry on the need for data to understand “how anganwadi services were delivered on the ground during the pandemic, and to assess the impact of COVID-19 on stunting and wasting levels,” according to a member. While the government has launched an app called Poshan Tracker to monitor delivery of services at 14 lakh anganwadis, the officials told the panel that the data is beginning to be uploaded only from June 1. “The Ministry has not been able to satisfy the committee. It said they have collected feedback from States, but there is no sanction for a survey”, another member told . The Ministry also made a presentation on children orphaned during COVID-19 and apprised the panel of various measures being taken to help them, including funds for family and institutional care, revising norms for child care institutions as well as maintaining monthly reports on foster care for such children. The panel is learnt to have expressed its disbelief on the NCPCR submission before the Supreme Court that there were 3,500 children orphaned during the pandemic. “This number is not justified when we know that lakhs of people have died due to COVID-19. The figure is too low.”Though the government has announced a corpus of ₹10 lakh from PM CARES for such children, “there has been no spending from PM CARES yet, and the responses from the Ministry were very ambiguous” the member said.

"Insistence on Class 12 CBSE, ICSE physical exams ‘irrational’, says Supreme Court","The Union of India’s question “who is to blame if a student dies” saw the Supreme Court toss out insistent pleas by some parents claiming that the COVID-19 graph is in free fall and the internal assessment schemes for  should be chucked in favour of physical exams. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari on Tuesday stood by the Union’s principle that “every student’s life is precious”. Also read: Attorney General K.K. Venugopal, for the Union, said, “Suppose a number of students who attend written exams get the infection, suppose a student dies… Who is to blame? It is neither safe nor prudent to have written exams”. The court asked Andhra Pradesh, which intends to conduct the State Board exams but has deferred a final decision to July, to make its position clear in an affidavit by Wednesday. “If there is even a single fatality, we will make the State responsible,” it warned. Kerala had filed an affidavit opting for exams for Class 11. The court said it would pass orders on the State’s choice. The court found the insistence on physical exams “irrational”. Justice Maheshwari said students cannot be left in uncertainty about their health and future. Also read: The CBSE and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which conducts the ICSE exams, shared the Union’s apprehensions about putting children in harm’s way, especially with medical experts warning about a looming third wave. “Children are most vulnerable, that too, without vaccination,” advocate J.K. Das, for the CISCE, said. The court said the CBSE and CISCE assessment schemes were “fair and reasonable” and caused no prejudice to the students. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, for a parents’ association, argued that students should be allowed, at the very threshold, to choose between internal assessment and written exams. Mr. Venugopal countered, “In the present system, a student gets the best of two worlds. If he or she has not scored good marks in the internal assessment, they can opt for physical exams which would be held when the situation is conducive. Mr. Singh’s suggestion takes away the student’s choice to improve his marks”. The Attorney General quelled apprehensions that different dates for declaration of results by the CBSE, CISCE and the State Boards would lead to students of one board stealing a march over the others. “The UGC would wait for all the boards to declare their results before announcing the dates for admissions to colleges and institutions,” he assured. Mr. Venugopal refuted claims that the assessment schemes facilitated “manipulation of marks”. He explained that every school would have a Result Committee to certify the marks based on reasoned decisions. “Besides, manipulation would mean forgery, which attracts a punishment of seven years’ imprisonment… Will any school principal want that?,” he stated. The top law officer objected to a submission that the CBSE and the CISCE should follow the same criteria in their respective assessment schemes. The court acknowledged his reasoning that the CBSE and the ICSE were “independent and autonomous bodies” and the criteria were fixed by experts after long deliberations.

Indian students unable to reach Australia due to travel restrictions,"When 19-year old Pranavi Jamwal got admission last year into one of the world’s top ten political science programmes at Australia’s top university which has produced Nobel Laureates and Prime Ministers, she was thrilled. The only problem? Rather than mingling with fellow students at The Australian National University’s prestigious Canberra campus, she has been stuck at home in New Delhi, waking up for 4 a.m. online classes. “COVID has disrupted my plans, and the Australian government is unable to give any clear timeline when I will be allowed to enter the country, and it now looks that at least half my course will be online,” she said. “I’m the only student in my class who is trying to join the lectures online as all the others are on campus, so it is quite isolating. In Australia, they want to create a COVID-free environment, rather than learn to deal with COVID like Europe is doing.”Avtar Saini is in an even more dire situation. The 23-year- old, studying for a Bachelor of Professional Accounting at Holmes Institute in Queensland, was in the final year of his programme when he came home to Kurukshetra on March 4, 2020 on a family visit. Two weeks later, Australia shut its borders, leaving him stranded. “I was not aware they would ban our entry. I have been trying to defer classes, as it is hard to understand a mathematical subject online. But I may have to start online classes in July, as my visa is also expiring in October,” he said. “I have a rental house there on my contract, as well as a car for which I am still paying,” he added. Faced with closed borders, the number of Indian students heading to Australia has been sinking since the pandemic began. According to IDP Education, which cited Australian government data, Indian students granted an Australian visa dropped from 21,433 in 2019-20 to 11,200 in 2020-21. Last week, two Australian States announced plans to start a pilot programme to allow international students back into the country at the rate of about 800 per month. Australia’s High Commissioner to India Brian O’Farrell admits that the scope of the problem is much larger, but says this is an important first step. “We have over 470,000 people who are entitled to be in Australia, studying whether in postgraduate, research, undergraduate or other elements of education, and currently 150,000 of those are offshore,” he told  in a recent interview. “I'm not wishing to get their hopes up any higher. But what is positive is that two states, including Australia's largest state, only last week announced pilot programmes to demonstrate not just to the federal government, but to the Australian community, that international students can return to our shores without there being a community health problem,” he said. International students may be able to return at the end of the first semester in 2022. “I'm optimistic about next year. Do I think that's going to placate the students here in India who should have been in Australia? No, and I have great sympathy for them,” said Mr. O’Farrell. Deepesh Batra no longer believes such assurances from the Australian government. The 25-year-old was admitted into a Masters in Information Technology programme at the University of Wollongong and has deferred classes, rather than take them online. “They are misguiding students, giving false promises before each new intake, so that students are lured into applying. But each time, the timelines have been extended,” he said, noting that Australia was unwilling to commit to the “scientific approach” of allowing vaccinated students to enter the country. “A group of us have been writing emails to Mr. O’Farrell as well as the Australian Education Minister Alan Tudge, who has gone so far as to block some Indian students on Twitter, but there is no clarity,” he said, adding that the Indian Ministry of External Affairs also collected students’ details last month. Umang Kalia, a 20-year old from Ludhiana is struggling with online classes for a Bachelor’s degree in Nursing at Australia’s youngest university, Torrens University. “You cannot study a practical medical programme in this way. I have already failed one course, for which I had to pay tuition fees again,” he said. “Overall, I am paying ₹16 lakh for one year, including for sports and accommodation facilities that I cannot benefit from. They are offering a 5% scholarship which is not enough. My family has put all our savings so I could go to Australia, but there is no use in this,” he said. “We are not actively recommending Australia to any of our students right now,” said Akshay Chaturvedi, founder of Leverage Edu, an agency facilitating foreign study for Indian students. “We get about 2,000 applications each month, and Australia aspirants have dropped from 20% to less than 5%. Pre-COVID, Australia was leading the charts, but the scenario has shifted. The pilot programmes are good news, but there needs to be more clarity and better communication,” he added. Mr. O’Farrell believes that in the long run, Australia’s focus on health will pay off and make it competitive again as a destination for Indian students. “Firstly, its quality.

Four theatre commands likely to be raised by year-end,"While deliberations continue for a consensus on the creation of the military’s integrated theatre commands, the four proposed commands are likely be raised by year-end, according to a government official. On Tuesday, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen. Bipin Rawat chaired a meeting with the Vice Chiefs of the three Services, the Chief of Integrated Defence Staff and representatives from the Ministries of Defence, Home and Finance to iron out differences on the integrated theatre commands’ creation. While details of the deliberations were not known, an official source said more deliberations would be held. It was expected that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would make an announcement on the creation of the commands, which would be the biggest reorganisation of the Indian armed forces since Independence, and the commands were likely to be raised by year-end, two official sources said. The four commands planned are air defence command, maritime theatre command, integrated eastern theatre command and integrated western theatre command. “A maritime theatre commander will not be appointed right away. The command will be first raised and commander appointed later,” a source said. Several officials had stated that the Indian Air Force (IAF) has major reservations over the creation of the commands. There have also been questions on the naming of the commands. The IAF was for all commands to be rotational and so wanted the naming to be domain specific, one of the sources said. “It has been broadly agreed but initially they would be with respective service commander till the command stabilises,” the source stated. The need was integrated joint planning and not coordinated or syncing of operations as was done now. Single Service operations were not efficient or made the best use of the resources, the official said . The proposed change was that at the highest level, instead of one Service making a single plan that was then routed through the headquarters and the Integrated Defence Command (IDS), in the new plan, they would be held by a three- star commander and integrated with other two domains, the source explained. “These plans will be presented to Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC) as opposed to a single plan being presented to a Chief,” the official stated. “The operational functions will shift to theatre commands, which will involve the creation of joint structures in headquarters IDS,” the source noted. Stating that there would be little to no financial outflow involved, the source said there was only creation of a headquarters and no movement of assets or personnel. “It is only reorganising ourselves in a better manner within existing resources,” the official added.

"Coronavirus | Delta plus is a variant of concern, says government","The Centre on Tuesday termed the emerging  a ‘variant of concern’ just hours after Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan and chairman, National Empowered Group on Vaccination V.K. Paul said it was only a ‘variant of interest (VoI)’. A variant of concern (VoC) carries the highest threat perception of a coronavirus variant, which is characterised by increased infectivity, transmissibility or resistance to vaccines and treatment. A VoI is a degree lower. Also read | The World Health Organisation, as of June 14, had classified  as well as offshoots — AY.1 and AY.2 — as . Delta plus, as the variant is sometimes referred to, is an informal name. So far there are only four international VoC (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) with the off-shoots, AY.1 and AY.2 classified as off-shoots of Delta. “Delta variant is a Variant of Concern and has been found in 80 countries. Delta plus is in 9 countries and as of now is in the category of variant of interest and is not yet in the variant of concern categor,” said Bhushan at the weekly press briefing on Tuesday. However in a press statement, the Ministry first referred to it as a ‘variant of concern’ then issued a correction calling it a ‘variant of interest’ and then again reverted to calling it a ‘variant of concern’. A scientist connected with the consortium, INSACOG, (Indian SarsCov2 Genomic Consortia) told  on condition of anonymity that AY.1 was “always” a variant of concern but was wrongly classified by the Health Ministry as a VoI. On Tuesday, the Health Ministry wrote to States to take up immediate containment measures, enhanced testing, tracking and vaccination in districts and clusters where the Delta Plus variant is found and ensure that “adequate samples” of positive persons be promptly sent to designated laboratories of INSACOG so that the clinical epidemiological correlations could be made. Though a record 8.8 million vaccines administered on Monday only 46% were administered to women. This “gender imbalance” needed to be corrected in the days ahead, said Dr. Paul.

Afghan violence has risen: Jaishankar,"Talks between the Afghanistan government and the Taliban have not resulted in any reduction in violence, said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, pointing out that reports from the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) showed a major increase in violence despite the talks and a U.S.-Taliban agreement last year. However, he said India is ‘supportive’ of the Intra-Afghan negotiations, and called for the United Nations to play a “leading role” in the reconciliation process. “Violence has only increased, especially after May 1,” Mr. Jaishankar told the U.N. Security Council at a special meeting on Tuesday, as he referred to the May deadline that had originally been agreed to as a date for the U.S. troops pull-out from Afghanistan. “The country has been witnessing targeted attacks on religious and ethnic minorities, girl students, Afghan security forces, Ulemas [clerics], women occupying positions of responsibility, journalists, civil rights activists and youth,” he said, calling for a “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”.  
Indian delegation met Taliban in Doha, says Qatari official
According to the UNAMA report that was detailed by U.N. Secretary General’s Special Representative Deborah Lyons, civilian casualties have increased by 29% in the first quarter of 2021, compared to last year, and women casualties increased by 37% and child casualties by 23%. Ms. Lyons said not only has the Taliban captured more territory in the last few weeks but also seems poised to take over key cities once the foreign troops pull out. American envoy to the U.N. Linda Thomas Greenfield defended the U.S. move to pull out troops as a carefully considered decision, but warned the Taliban that taking the “military path” would not bring the group legitimacy. Without making any direct references to Pakistan or any particular terror group, Mr. Jaishankar called for an end to “terrorist safe havens” and “terrorist supply chains” as well as cross-border terror, and said the international community must ensure that transit trade from Afghanistan to the “high seas” is allowed. Also read |  “It is equally important to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country.”Afghanistan Foreign Minister Hanif Atmar, who attended the UNSC meeting, was more candid accusing the Taliban of keeping its links with the al-Qaeda and Pakistan-based terror groups including the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. He said as the withdrawal of the U.S.-NATO troops is completed, the international community would see that the Taliban has not kept any of its promises, including the promise to cut ties with international terrorism, to reduce violence and work towards a ceasefire and to reach a political settlement with the government of Afghanistan.

"Stop playing politics over pandemic, BJP tells Rahul","Hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi released a ‘white paper’ on the Union government’s handling of COVID-19 crisis and termed it disastrous, the BJP accused him of playing politics over the pandemic and of the Congress-ruled States managing the pandemic badly. BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra addressed a press conference at the party’s headquarters in New Delhi to launch an attack on the Congress. “Since yesterday we have been fearing this. Whenever something good happens in our fight against coronavirus, the Congress and Rahul Gandhi specially do something to derail it,” he said. “Yesterday was a significant day when India became the first country in the world to administer 87 lakh vaccine doses in one day. People seemed excited and jubilant. There is a feeling that India is winning in its fight against coronavirus, just then Rahul Gandhi spoke of white paper and tried to derail it,” he stated. “Whenever we are at a crossroads in our fight, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party have tried to derail the efforts by playing politics. In fact, the Congress has really worked tirelessly to create hurdles and obstacles in our path,” he alleged. Mr. Patra accused the Congress-led States of mishandling the pandemic, even saying that the second wave began with a Congress-ruled State. The most number of those infected were from the Congress-ruled States and so were the most number of deaths. The maximum vaccine hesitancy was seen in the Congress-ruled States and so was the highest COVID-19 positivity rate, he observed. “The demand for decentralisation of vaccines came from the Congress-ruled States and the U-turn demanding centralisation too came from them. Instead of virtual press conferences and white papers, Rahul Gandhi should go to such States and give them this data,” he said. Mr. Patra called Mr. Gandhi “confused” and charged the Congress with making contradictory demands. “First they called the lockdown ‘Tughlaki’, then they questioned why there was no lockdown.... They promoted vaccine hesitancy... I would like to ask Rahul Gandhi how long will he conduct just virtual press conferences? When will you do some real work? Go to the States ruled by your party and see the situation there. How vaccines are being wasted in Rajasthan, how vaccine profiteering is happening in Punjab and how Chhattisgarh is misusing vaccines. Go to the ground and survey,” he added.

No balance doses of direct state procurement pending with Covid vaccine manufacturers: Government," The health ministry on Tuesday said the Centre had ensured that the full supplies of COVID-19 vaccines under direct state procurement were provided to the States concerned before June 21. The ministry issued a statement, saying certain media reports have alleged non-supply of free vaccines for the 18-44 priority age group to the Delhi government amid the ongoing free COVID-19 vaccination drive. ""It is clarified that the Government of India had ensured that full supplies of COVID-19 vaccines under the direct state procurement were provided to the concerned States before June 21,"" the statement said. According to the state procurement data, the allocated 5.6 lakh doses of direct state procurement were supplied to Delhi before June 21 by the vaccine manufacturers. Further, an additional 8.8 lakh vaccine doses under the Centre's procurement were provided to Delhi for free and more are in the pipeline, which will be supplied by June-end, the statement said. As on June 22, Delhi has over 9.9 lakh unutilised doses of Covid vaccines, it added. With effect from June 21, both the state government and Government of India supplies, irrespective of the type of supply, are to be used to vaccinate people above 18 years of age as all categories of priority groups are now unified and are to be provided vaccination for free at the state-designated government Covid vaccination centres (CVCs), the statement said.

PM hails ‘Centre-State bhagidari’ in ushering ‘reforms by conviction and incentives’ during Covid,"India has moved from a model of ‘reforms by stealth and compulsion’ to a new model of ‘reforms by conviction and incentives’, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday, referring to States being granted additional borrowing limits last year under a reform-linked window.  Raising enough resources for public welfare while ensuring sustainability is proving to be one of the biggest challenges for governments during the pandemic, the Prime Minister pointed out, but Indian States were able to borrow an extra ₹1.06 lakh crore in 2020-21.   “For a large nation with complex challenges as ours, this was a unique experience. We have often seen that for various reasons, schemes and reforms remain un-operational often for years,” he said in a post on the job search and social networking portal LinkedIn.  Seventeen States that facilitated Ration card portability and installed electronic point of sale devices at fair price shops, were granted additional borrowings amounting to ₹37,600 crore, the Prime Minister noted. Similarly, 20 States completed reforms to ease the red tape faced by businesses to avail borrowings of ₹39,521 crore.  “The third reform required States to notify floor rates of property tax and of water & sewerage charges, in consonance with stamp duty guideline values for property transactions and current costs respectively, in urban areas. 11 states completed these reforms and were granted additional borrowing of ₹15,957 crore,” he added, stressing that the urban poor would benefit the most from this step.   The least traction was seen for the Union government’s reform idea of replacing free electricity for farmers with a Direct Benefit Transfer. States were asked to frame a scheme with actual implementation in one district on a pilot basis by the end of 2021, for an additional borrowing limit of 0.15% of GSDP. Loans worth another 0.10% of GSDP were linked to reducing the gap between revenues and costs and reducing technical and commercial losses in the power sector. “13 states implemented at least one component, while 6 states implemented the DBT component. As a result, ₹13,201 crore of additional borrowings was permitted,” the Prime Minister said in his post.   “This nudge for reform is rare in Indian public finance. This was a nudge, incentivising the states to adopt progressive policies to avail additional funds. The results of this exercise are not only encouraging but also run contrary to the notion that there are limited takers for sound economic policies,” Mr. Modi emphasised.  ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-hails-centre-state-bhagidari-in-ushering-reforms-by-conviction-and-incentives-during-covid/article34905689.ece

Rahul Gandhi releases White Paper on Centre’s handling of COVID-19,"Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday claimed at a press meet that 90 % of the deaths during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were “needless” as lives could have been saved if oxygen and medicines were available. Releasing a white paper on the , he said it should now prepare for a third wave by ramping up health infrastructure and vaccinating citizens on a war footing so that the virus did not get a ‘chance’ to mutate. The white paper suggests the creation of a COVID-19 compensation fund and a commission to find out “what went wrong” in the fight against the previous waves. Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for getting emotional in one of his virtual addresses, Mr. Gandhi said,“The Prime Minister’s tears cannot wipe the tears of those who lost their loved ones. The Prime Minister’s tears did not save their lives but oxygen may have saved them. The Prime Minister didnt take this seriously. He was busy fighting elections in Bengal and his focus was in another direction”. The purpose of the white paper was not to point fingers at the government, but to help it deal with the third wave by preparing a blueprint to react, he stressed. In a subsequent tweet, he said the government of India “must work on our constructive inputs in the interest of the country”. “This is a blueprint on how to react to the third wave, which is going to come. It is our intention to provide the government with information and insights on what went wrong,” he said, adding, “If the second wave was bad, the third wave would be worse”. The white paper, he observed, was the result of extensive discussions held with experts and within the Congress structure and had four main pillars. The first pillar talked about what went wrong and the Congress’s suggestions, including one to have a commission to probe the shortcomings; the second one focussed on developing the critical infrastructure such as oxygen supply and hospital beds; the third one highlighted financial assistance to the poorest families and the final one was about creation of a COVID-19 fund to compensate the families that have lost the breadwinner. The corona virus was not just a biological phenomena but also an economic and social phenomena and that’s why economic support must be given to the poorest people as well as small and medium businesses, Mr. Gandhi asserted. “The Centre is making ₹ 4 lakh crore from taxes on diesel and petrol every year. It is taking money out of the pockets of people who have lost family members. So, I don’t understand, why it can’t put some money back into their pocket,” he noted. The white paper release coincided with  hosting a section of Opposition leaders at his residence. Asked to comment about it, Mr. Gandhi said, “I am not going to distract you or myself by getting into what is going on in the politics and what is going on here and there. There is a time and place to that discussion and I am happy to talk to you at that time”.

Advocate Ashok Panigrahi, appearing for the Union of India, told the court about the adjournment letter.

The bail application said Perarivalan had been “under the hangman’s noose for 16 years and 29 years in solitary confinement out of the total 30 years of incarceration”. He has suffered the pain and trauma of the death row syndrome. “The pain was equally felt by his ageing and fragile parents due to the uncertainty between life and death, and hope and despair,” the application said.

Narada case | Supreme Court judge recuses himself from hearing Mamata appeal,"Supreme Court judge Justice Aniruddha Bose on Tuesday recused himself from  by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Law Minister Moloy Ghatak and West Bengal government against the Calcutta High Court’s refusal to immediately consider their affidavits countering allegations about their role on the day of arrest of four TMC leaders by the CBI in the Narada sting tape case.

However, this Bench, on the consent of the parties, adjourned the hearing to June 25. The parties assured that the case would be concluded on Friday itself. The Saran Bench further requested the Calcutta High Court, which is seized of the Narada case, to not take up the matter for hearing before June 25. The High Court had scheduled a hearing on June 23. On June 18, a Vacation Bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V. Ramasubramanian had requested the Calcutta High Court to defer its scheduled hearing of the Narada case to June 23.

A separate plea by Ms. Banerjee in the Supreme Court during the weekend contended that the CBI was trying to malign the State Ministers without any proof to substantiate its allegations against them in the Narada case. She said it was essential to allow her to file an affidavit to counter the agency's claims that she “terrorised” them by protesting outside their office.

A total of 82,70,212 doses were administered across the country, including the first and second shots, till 9 p.m. According to the Union Health Ministry, the sharp spike was due to the “new phase of universalisation of COVID-19 vaccination which commenced from Monday (June 21)”.

As many as 51,455 new recoveries were recorded, taking the total to 2,89,70,237.  Yesterday we administered 56 lakh vaccine doses in rural India or about 63% of the total. So this shows that there is no neglect of rural areas in the vaccination drive, says Rajesh Bhushan, Health Secretary, in a press briefing. Yesterday we have administered 88.09 lakh doses and today, so far, it is 38 lakh. We are expecting it will be a significant number by evening, says Mr. Bhushan. ""There is a 90% decline in the number of daily new cases since the peak on 7th May. The weekly test positivity has declined to 3.4% this week from 21% in the first week of May. There are 553 districts with a test positivity less than 5%.""""The number of doses administered yesterday was 88.09 lakh doses. This is well beyond our expectations and shows what the country is capable of,"" says Dr. V.K. Paul. ""46% of those who received vaccine yesterday were women, we need to correct this (gender) imbalance.""There are 22 instances of the Delta plus variant in India, it is still a variant of interest and not a variant of concern, says Mr. Bhushan. ""16 of the cases are in Maharashtra and the rest are in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh. The Health Ministry today has issued an advisory to these States on what public health measures they should initiate. Currently the threat seems to be small but we wouldn't want it to increase to concerning proportions.""""So far the INSACOG labs have finished sequencing 45,000 samples for genomes that may be the new variants. Many countries have expressed interest in taking the technology underlying the COWIN platform because it has proved itself to be reliable and resilient to crashes. We are planning a global webinar to invite other countries to better understand the technology and we would be willing to share it.""""The increase in vaccinations yesterday wasn't sudden. The average number of vaccinations was nearly 34 lakh per day from 1st June to 21st June. To go from there to 88 lakh is possible, when vaccines and capacity is available. This was a result of coordinated planning between states and Centre. This is expected to continue,"" says Mr. Bhushan. , the highest ever in a single day.

The Congress released a report on COVID-19 mismanagement prepared by the Research Department of the party at a press conference. Rahul Gandhi, at the press conference, said, the white paper was not to point fingers at anyone ""to correct the shortcomings in the future"". The report is based on discussion that took place within the Congress structure and experts, he said. ""Everyone had predicted a second wave but the government didn't have the correct response.""He said we were again at that stage where a third wave is likely to hit. ""That's why the government needs to be fully prepared. The propose of this white paper is not to point fingers at the government but to help the nation prepare for the third wave.""Calling it a blue print to deal with the third wave, he said, ""we are trying to give information to the government about where we went wrong.""Vaccination is the central pillar on which COVID-19 can be dealt with, Mr. Gandhi said. ""One pillar is what went wrong and our suggestion is to set up a commission to examine what went wrong.""The second pillar on which COVID-19 management stands is infrastructure ""that we didn't have in the first and second wave"", he added. He said the third pillar was economy. ""COVID-19 isn't just a biological disease but a social and economic ailment. We have been talking about giving assistance to the poor people.""""Fourth pillar is the COVID-19 compensation fund to help families that have lost bread winners.""Asked about NCP chief Sharad Pawar's scheduled meeting with Opposition leaders at his Delhi residence, Mr. Gandhi said his intention for the press conference was to bring focus on COVID-19. ""There is a time and place for discussion (on the Opposition conclave) and I am happy to discuss it then.""Calling Monday's record number of vaccinations in the country ""a good job done"", Mr. Gandhi said, ""We must make this a mission. This is a matter of life and death and the government must not view Indian States as BJP and Congress States. We have to fight corona in a decentralised manner. Everyone has a place (in the fight) -- the Prime Minister, Chief Minister, District Magistrate and the citizens.""""Dr. Manmohan Singh has given suggestions but you ridiculed him. Later, you had to accept the suggestions. You have to accept you've made mistakes; only then you can correct it,"" Mr. Gandhi said, addressing the Centre. The Centre was hiding the truth on the number of deaths, he alleged. ""The number is five to six times that provided by the government.""We can attack the government later, he said, stressing the need to address the looming threat of the third wave. ""If you thought the second wave was bad, the third wave is going to be worse!""During the second wave, 90% of the COVID-19 deaths in India were needless deaths mainly due to shortage of oxygen and not those owing to serious co-morbidities, he said. ""PM's tears can't wipe off the tears of the families who lost their loved ones, of those who died needlessly. PM Modi was not taking things seriously. His focus was on different things and fighting elections in Bengal. The PM was also engaged in marketing events like .""""Vaccination is the only solution. Deploy as many vaccines as possible on a war footing and in mission mode. India is the only country where people are paying for vaccines in private hospitals,"" he said. Mr. Gandhi alleged the gap fixed by the government between two doses was a political decision, that taken due to shortage of vaccines. ""The Centre is making Rs. 4 lakh crore from taxes on petrol and diesel. Why can't they give some of this back to the people? Families need the money to be productive.""Asked about vaccine hesitancy, particularly among women and Muslims, he said vaccination was a must and that awareness campaigns must be conducted. - Sandeep PhukanIndia recorded less than 50,000 new coronavirus infections, the lowest in 91 days, taking the total tally of cases to 2,99,77,861, while active cases fell below 7 lakh after 79 days, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on June 22.

SC asks Tamil Nadu to hold local body polls in newly carved districts by Sept. 15," The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission (SEC) time to work, if necessary 24 hours a day, and hold the local body elections in nine newly carved districts of the State by September 15. “Holding of elections is a constitutional obligation,” a Vacation Bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and Aniruddha Bose said. The court was not impressed by the SEC’s fervent pleas that COVID-19 was at its peak in the State. “COVID has become a good excuse in all matters. For two years, you have not conducted the elections... Now you conduct the elections before the third wave arrives... We know the reality in these matters, unless and until political parties are ready, elections are not held,” Justice Gupta said. The court said the notification for the elections was issued in 2019. “The delimitation was supposed to be done in four months,” Justice Gupta observed. The tenure of the previous local body had ended in 2018-2019. Appearing for the State poll body, senior advocate P. Narasimha said the local body elections had already been held, following which the nine districts were carved out. The delimitation had to be done before holding the elections. There was no delay on the part of the SEC. The pandemic had hit the State in the meanwhile. The court initially said the polls in the districts should be held in two months by August 31. Mr. Narasimha said two months was too short. He urged for more time. The election machinery had been moved to West Bengal for the recent Assembly elections, and it would take time for it to be set up in Tamil Nadu. “This is not about the efficiency of administration. It is a health matter... Tamil Nadu is having the highest number of COVID cases,” the senior lawyer said. Senior advocate P. Wilson, for Tamil Nadu, agreed with Mr. Narasimha, submitting that considering the “unusual circumstances (caused by COVID-19), what SEC says was true”. Justice Gupta, however, stood firm initially. “If you do not want August 31, then we will say August 15”. However, the Bench had a short discussion, after which Justice Gupta informed the lawyers that Justice Bose was agreeable to extending the deadline for the elections to September 15. “We grant extension of time till September 15 to complete the entire process,” Justice Gupta said in the order. In December last year, the Supreme Court had granted six months’ extension to complete the delimitation exercise and conduct the local body elections in the nine districts. A Bench led by then Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde had allowed an application filed by the State Election Commission to complete the delimitation exercise in these districts which was interrupted by the advent of the pandemic in March. The court had, on December 11 last year, ordered the completion of the delimitation exercise to the nine districts in three months. The districts in question are Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Vellore, Thirupathur, Ranipet, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Tirunelveli and Tenkasi.

"Central leadership will decide next CM in U.P., says Minister","A Cabinet Minister in the Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh has said that the Chief Minister would be decided by the party’s central leadership if the BJP wins again in the 2022 Assembly polls. The comment by State Labour Minister Swami Prasad Maurya on Sunday reflects the reported difference of opinion within the State BJP regarding the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, who was chosen as Chief Minister by the central leadership in 2017. The BJP had contested the 2017 polls without a CM face and largely on the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The questions now is if the party would enter the polls with the promise of a second term for the head priest of the Gorakshnath temple in Gorakhpur or keep the option open. The reluctance of first Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, and now Mr. Swami Prasad Maurya, to name Mr. Adityanath as the face of the campaign indicates disquiet within the ruling party. Responding to questions by journalists, Mr. Swami Prasad Maurya said the central leadership would choose the Chief Minister. “We will accept whoever comes,” he said.

The Lucknow Bench of the High Court also imposed a cost of ₹25,000 on the petitioner for filing a frivolous petition and wasting the court’s time.

Ravinder Goud. The State government had formed the SIT on July 11, 2020 to probe the case and it submitted its report to the government on November 4.

"Guarantee wheat procurement till July 15, Priyanka urges U.P. CM","Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday, demanded that the State government guarantee wheat procurement while flagging several problems faced by wheat farmers. She said there should be a guarantee that wheat from farmers would be procured by procurement centres till July 15. “Wheat procurement started from April 1, but due to the corona pandemic, the purchase centres remained locked. As soon as the farmers’ wheat started reaching the procurement centres, the procurement was reduced to half,” Ms. Vadra said. The Congress leader said she was constantly getting information from all the districts of the State that farmers were facing a lot of problems in selling their wheat produce. In Punjab and Haryana, the government procurement of wheat accounted for 80-85% of the total production while in Uttar Pradesh only 14% of the 378 lakh tonnes of wheat had been procured by the government centres, she claimed. The Congress leader said that though the Chief Minister had talked about extending procurement facilities to all farmers, in many villages the purchasing centres had been closed and the farmers were being ‘forced’ to travel to far away ‘mandis’. And with many parts experiencing incessant rains, she noted that there was a danger of wheat rotting due to moisture. Ms. Vadra cited media reports about a maximum of 30 or 50 quintals of wheat being purchased from a farmer at a time across several districts and noted it as a cause of worry. “In such a situation the farmers will be forced to sell their hard earned produce at throwaway prices,” she said. “Due to the pandemic and inflation, the condition of the farmers is already bad and if their crop is not procured or they are forced to sell wheat at throwaway prices, it will break their back,” Ms. Vadra added.
