The project is to use scrapy/xpath to scrape The Hindu website

There are two spiders here, One collects all the links that contain the description of the news (hindu spider)
The other spider collects the actual description, place and time stamp of the news (hindudesc spider)

The links are saved in page_links.csv
The heading, description, place, time stamp and the link of the news are saved in descriptions.csv
