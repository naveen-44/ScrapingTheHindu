The project is to use scrapy/xpath to scrape The Hindu website
For now, the spiders collect national news alone

There are two spiders here, One collects all the links that contain the description of the news (hindu spider)
The other spider collects the actual desreption of the news (hindu desc spider)

The links are saved in page_links.csv
The heading and description of the news are saved in descriptions.csv
